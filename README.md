AlphaCare Insurance Analytics
Project Overview

This repository contains the analytical and machine learning models developed as part of a project for AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS), a leading provider of car insurance services in South Africa. The primary goal of this project is to analyze historical insurance claim data and provide actionable insights to:

    Optimize marketing strategies for car insurance products.
    Identify low-risk client segments to offer competitive premiums and attract new customers.

The project focuses on applying advanced risk and predictive analytics, A/B hypothesis testing, and machine learning models to better understand key factors influencing insurance claims and premium structures.
Key Objectives

    Insurance Analysis
        Develop an understanding of insurance terminologies and workflows.
        Explore historical claim data to identify trends and anomalies.

    A/B Hypothesis Testing
        Evaluate risk differences across provinces and zip codes.
        Investigate profitability and risk differences by gender and location.
        Accept or reject null hypotheses to derive actionable insights.

    Machine Learning & Statistical Modeling
        Build a linear regression model to predict total claims for each zip code.
        Develop a machine learning model to estimate optimal premium values based on:
            Vehicle features
            Owner demographics
            Location attributes
            Other relevant data
        Analyze and report the significance of key features influencing predictions.

    Final Report
        Summarize methodologies, findings, and recommendations for improving insurance products tailored to consumer needs.
